Disease Detector
📌 Overview

The Disease Detector is a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data.
The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.
